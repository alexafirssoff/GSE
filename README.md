# Generalised Skyrme Equation Numerical Verification

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17474010.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17474010)

This repository contains two fully documented Python scripts that numerically verify and reproduce the core results described in the accompanying research paper on the **Generalised Skyrme Equation (GSE)** within the QEM framework. The scripts are designed to be transparent, parameter-free checks of the mathematical and physical consistency of the model, demonstrating the existence and stability of solitonic solutions and their role in baryon and lepton mass generation.

## Repository contents

### 1. `lagrangian_solver.py`

This is the **core numerical engine**. It solves the dimensionless **hedgehog equation of motion** derived from the SU(3) generalised Skyrme Lagrangian in the baryonic sector (B = 1):

> (1 + 2 sin²F / r²) F″ + (2/r) F′ − (sin(2F)/r²) [1 + (F′)² − sin²F / r²] = 0

with boundary conditions:

> F(0) = π,   and   rF′(R) + 2F(R) = 0.

#### Key functionality

* **Shooting + Newton solver**: combines Runge–Kutta integration and global Newton iteration with numerical Jacobian and backtracking to find the stable soliton profile F(r).
* **Energy and inertia integrals**: computes the dimensionless functionals

  * E₂ and E₄ (quadratic and quartic energy contributions),
  * E_stat = E₂ + E₄ (static energy),
  * Λ (moment of inertia), and their tail corrections.
* **Derrick scaling check**: verifies the virial theorem (E₂ ≈ E₄) via analytic rescaling λ* = √(E₄/E₂) and recomputes E_stat* and Λ*.
* **Small oscillations**: provides a crude spectral proxy for the lowest vibrational modes, confirming the stability of the soliton.

After convergence, the code outputs the canonical dimensionless integrals:

```
I_M ≈ 52.16
I_I ≈ 54.42
```

These correspond exactly to the values used in the paper for calibration and mass prediction.

#### Physical interpretation

The results confirm that the hedgehog profile obtained from the GSE represents a genuine stable minimum of the energy functional. The integrals I_M and I_I define the universal dimensionless scale governing both baryon and lepton sectors, once calibrated via the nucleon–Δ mass splitting.

### 2. `mass_calculation.py`

This script performs the **calibration and spectrum verification** based on the output of the solver. It directly implements the algebraic relations from Section 4 of the paper:

* Calibrates the model constants f_π and e using experimental nucleon and Δ masses:

  > M_sol = (f_π / e) I_M,  I = (1 / (e³ f_π)) I_I.
* Derives the universal energy scale f_π / e and verifies M_sol ≈ 865.6 MeV.
* Computes lepton masses in the topologically trivial (B = 0) sector using the same scale, with a single normalisation factor κ fixed by the electron mass.

Predicted masses:

| Particle | Status    | Predicted (MeV) | Experimental (MeV) | Δ (%) |
| -------- | --------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ----- |
| e⁻       | input     | 0.511           | 0.511              | +0.00 |
| μ⁻       | predicted | 105.75          | 105.66             | +0.09 |
| τ⁻       | predicted | 1778.0          | 1776.9             | +0.07 |

The deviations are below 0.1%, confirming the parameter-free predictive accuracy of the model.

#### Shape-invariant functional

An optional part of the script introduces the **shape functional S[F]**, defined in the paper's Appendix E, intended to test the conjecture of shape universality between topological (B = 1) and non-topological (B = 0) solutions. The framework for this test is implemented but requires separate numerical profiles for the B = 0 sector to complete.

## Relation to the paper

Together, the two scripts reproduce the entire quantitative chain of reasoning in the article:

1. From the **Euler–Lagrange equation** derived from the GSE,
2. through its **dimensionless soliton solution**,
3. to the **universal geometric integrals** I_M and I_I,
4. and finally to the **physical mass spectrum** of baryons and leptons.

No fitting parameters are introduced beyond experimental calibration of (f_π, e), and all numerical values match those presented in the paper with machine-level consistency.

## Notes for users

* All computations are dimensionless; units (MeV) enter only in the mass-calibration stage.
* The scripts are written for clarity and reproducibility; performance was not a design goal.
* The code can be extended to explore higher topological sectors or test shape universality.

## Summary

This repository serves as a transparent, fully documented verification of the QEM/Generalised Skyrme framework. It numerically demonstrates that the GSE hedgehog is a stable finite-energy soliton whose derived integrals yield, upon calibration, an accurate and predictive model of the lepton and baryon mass spectra—without empirical fine-tuning.
